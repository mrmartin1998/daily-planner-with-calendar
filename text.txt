Let's discuss the calendar feature strategy. Looking at the roadmap, we need to implement:
Daily view
Weekly view
Monthly view
Navigation between views
For the calendar implementation, we'll need to consider several aspects:
Data Structure
Tasks will need to be organized by date
We'll need to handle date ranges for weekly/monthly views
Each view will need different data grouping strategies
UI Components Needed
Calendar Container
View switcher (Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
Navigation controls (Previous/Next/Today)
Header with current date/range
Daily View
Timeline view with hours
Task slots aligned with time
Task preview cards
Weekly View
7-day grid layout
Day headers with dates
Task previews within day cells
Monthly View
Month grid with weeks
Day cells with dates
Task indicators/previews
